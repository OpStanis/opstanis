1. Concept & Planning
	Idea & Theme: Define the core concept of your game. What genre is it? (e.g., puzzle, action, adventure, etc.) Whatâ€™s the story or theme?
	Target Audience: Who will play your game? Kids, casual gamers, or hardcore gamers? This will influence your design and complexity.
	Platform Selection: Decide whether you want your game on mobile (iOS/Android), PC, or other platforms.
	Monetization Strategy: Will your game be free with ads, have in-app purchases, or be a paid app?
2. Game Design
	Core Mechanics: Define the main gameplay loop. What do players do in the game? (e.g., jump, solve puzzles, shoot enemies)
	Controls: How will players interact with the game? Will it be touch-based (mobile) or keyboard/mouse (PC)?
	Level Design: Plan the gameâ€™s levels or stages. What challenges and progression will players face?
3. Development Tools
â€¢	Game Engine: Choose an engine that fits your needs:
	Unity: Great for both 2D and 3D games, supports multiple platforms (iOS, Android, PC).
	Unreal Engine: Known for high-quality 3D games and visually stunning graphics.
	Godot: Open-source and beginner-friendly for 2D games.
	Cocos2d: Focused on 2D games, simple but powerful.
4. Prototype
	Quick & Dirty Prototype: Create a basic version of the game with core mechanics to test if the concept is fun. This doesn't need to be pretty â€“ itâ€™s just to test gameplay.
 	Playtesting: Get feedback from a few users to understand what's working and what's not.
5. Asset Creation
  Graphics: Design the visual elements (characters, environments, UI). You can either create these yourself or hire artists.
  Animations: Animate characters, objects, and other elements (movement, transitions).
  Sound Effects & Music: Either create your own or source royalty-free audio.
